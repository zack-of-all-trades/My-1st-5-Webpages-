        <h1>Motivational Speech on Never Give Up!</h1>
        <p>Some people say that there exist two types of people in this world: <em>successful and failure</em>. But I say there exists only 
            one type of people and that is only successful persons. I think there is no person who is a failure.  Every man is successful in 
            their life more or less.</p>

        <h4>We all try with our heart and soul to do any work.</h4>     
        <p> But in that work everyone is trying to win. So, everyone of course will not be the winner. Someone has to fail. Unfortunately, 
            one person wins and the other one fails. The person who fails is not actually a failure. He is also the winner. This time he 
            failed. But the next time he will succeed. If he tries one day he will surely win. But before winning he has failed several times. 
            So, can we say that he is actually a failure? No, of course not. This failing was some steps to the success. This failing is just 
            a part of his success. So, failing is a part and parcel of our life. If a person fails that doesn’t means that he is a failure or 
            a loser. Rather this means that he is the winner of the future. The one who fails several times doesn’t actually fail. He just 
            finds several ways that doesn’t work. Then why he will be known as a failure? So, if we fail this doesn’t mean that I will not be 
            able to succeed. This means that I will succeed next time.  We have to remember one thing that to succeed without trying is not 
            good. <strong><em>But to try and fail is better.</em></strong></p> 
        
        <h4>The opportunity, the situation, the time to succeed will not create automatically for us.</h4> 
        <p>We have to create these for us. If we fail in any work, we have to do it in any other way through which we can do the work 
            properly. But we cannot give up. We have to think differently. We have to look from any other angle. We have to prevent it so 
            that we don’t do the work in the same way in future and fail the same way.  For example, if I was walking on the road and didn’t 
            realize that there was a banana trash on it. Suddenly, I slipped and fell. The next day, I put the trash off the road so that I 
            wouldn’t fall ever again. I have to realize the reason for my fail and then I have to <strong><em>find another way to succeed
            </em></strong>. Giving up will not make a failure successful. It will not solve all the problems. If a man really wants to 
            succeed then he has to try several times.</p> 

        <h4>Why do we give up?</h4>
        <p></p> If we give up then our life will be a waste. We have to believe that we can do everything we want. We are the best. Today I 
            am a failure but one day I surely will be a successful man. Today I am running after the success. But one day success will run 
            after me. Giving up is just a waste. We have to keep this in mind. There can be found no person who gave up and become successful 
            in his life. But there can be found a lot of people who tried, tried and tried but didn’t give up, became successful one day. 
            With the hope we can go far. We have to always keep this in mind one day we can go away more. Today somebody else is ruling the 
            world but one day we have to rule the world. So, we cannot give up this way. We have to rise and show the world; prove the world 
            our real, true identity, what we are. One day we will rule the world. We have to be prepared. Giving up doesn’t make any sense. 
            Rather its just a waste of our life. Then why… why do we give up? Let’s ask this question to ourselves when we give up. Is it 
            good to give up; is it important to give up? We all have to fail yesterday, today or tomorrow. But this doesn’t mean that we will 
            not be able to succeed. If we try, <strong><em>success will</em></strong> come to us and beg to us. <strong><em>Success will</em>
            </strong> knock at our door and will cry to accept the success.The only thing we have to do is don’t ever give up as long as we 
            are alive. We cannot give up. We were not born to give up. We have to be successful and we will be successful because <strong><em>
            we were born to succeed</em></strong>.
